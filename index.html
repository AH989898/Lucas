  <summary>Lucas's Journey</summary>
  <p>Lucas was the kind of person everyone found easy to like. He had a warm, boyish smile that could light up a room, and his enthusiasm for life was infectious. Growing up in a small, picturesque town surrounded by mountains, Lucas spent most of his time outdoors. His interests were as diverse as the seasons. He loved hiking through the woods, sketching the landscapes he saw, and playing guitar on quiet evenings.
<p>

From an early age, Lucas had a creative streak. He loved to draw, turning blank pages into vibrant works of art with his colored pencils. By the time he reached high school, his passion for music blossomed. He joined the school band and quickly became known for his soulful guitar playing. Music gave him a way to express emotions he couldn’t put into words, and it became his greatest escape.
<p>

But beneath his cheerful exterior, Lucas always felt a quiet confusion he couldn't quite name. As his friends talked endlessly about crushes on girls, Lucas would smile and nod, pretending to share their excitement. Yet, deep down, he felt... different.
<p>
One summer evening, while strumming his guitar at the park, Lucas met a boy named Ethan. Ethan had just moved to town, and he had a kind smile and a love for photography. They quickly bonded over their shared passion for the arts, spending hours wandering through the town, Ethan snapping pictures while Lucas played tunes to match the mood of the scenery.
<p>

Their friendship felt different to Lucas. With Ethan, he felt seen in a way he hadn’t before, and for the first time, he began to question what these feelings meant. Was this just admiration? Or something more?
<p>
The moment of clarity came one night during a small local concert. Lucas and Ethan sat side by side in the dimly lit venue, their shoulders brushing. When the band played a slow, heartfelt song, Lucas turned to see Ethan looking at him with a smile that made his heart race. At that moment, Lucas realized he wasn’t just drawn to Ethan’s personality—he had feelings for him.
<p>
It wasn’t an easy journey to come to terms with this realization. Lucas wrestled with self-doubt, fear, and the societal pressures of his small-town life. But with time, he found courage in small steps. He confided in his older sister, Mia, who had always been his greatest ally. When he nervously told her, she wrapped him in a hug and said, “Lucas, you deserve to love and be loved, just as you are.”
<p>
With her support, Lucas started to embrace his identity. He didn’t need to shout it from the rooftops, but he began to live more authentically. His music took on a new depth, his sketches became more vibrant, and his bond with Ethan grew stronger.
<p>
One evening, Lucas finally found the courage to tell Ethan how he felt. Under the soft glow of streetlights, Ethan smiled and admitted he felt the same. It was the beginning of a new chapter for Lucas—one where he could fully be himself, not just in his art but in his life.
<p>
From that point on, Lucas’s world seemed brighter. He realized that discovering who you are isn’t a single moment but a journey. And with each step, he felt more confident in walking his own path, one that celebrated his interests, his passions, and his love.</p>
